The repository files are:

1. _YukonChinookFecundity.csv_ contains data on Chinook salmon fecundity
2. _try-many-inits-function.R_ contains a function for estimating the non-linear regression
3. _YukonChinookFecundity.R_ contain the code to run the regression analyses

To run the analyses, open the file _YukonChinookFecundity.R_ and run the code. The original analyses were run in R version 3.6.1.
